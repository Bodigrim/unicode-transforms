Run commands from the top dir of the package.

1) "stack build" will build an executable named normalizefile from
the source file benchmark/NormalizeFile.hs.

2) objdump -d .stack-work/install/x86_64-linux/lts-5.16/7.10.3/bin/normalizefile > normalizefile.asm
3) search for the regex "cmp.*\$0xc0," in the asm file (first match). That
instruction is inside the loop we want to examine.
put a breakpoint on that (br *0xaddr).

4) start gdb and run the following commands
handle SIGVTALRM ignore
file .stack-work/install/x86_64-linux/lts-5.16/7.10.3/bin/normalizefile
br *0x4088de # set breakpoint
disp/i $rip
run benchmark/data/English.txt
# stepi in a loop
